This page holds Mehbang Evaluation Kit (MevKit) sample codes.
Visit video tutorials on STM32 embedded coding using STM32CubeMX on [Mehbang website](http://mehbang.group).

# How To Use
Have the latest version of Keil uVision5 and STM32CubeMX installed with the updated STM32F1 libraries. Open the "ioc" file in STM32CubeMX, "Generate" the code so that the libraries are again copied to the project folder. Open the Keil project, compile it, program and reset the board. Be sure to always take a look at STM32F103C8 [Datasheet](https://www.st.com/resource/en/datasheet/stm32f103c8.pdf), [Reference Manual](https://www.st.com/resource/en/reference_manual/cd00171190-stm32f101xx-stm32f102xx-stm32f103xx-stm32f105xx-and-stm32f107xx-advanced-armbased-32bit-mcus-stmicroelectronics.pdf), and [Description of HAL & LL Drivers](https://www.st.com/resource/en/user_manual/dm00154093-description-of-stm32f1-hal-and-lowlayer-drivers-stmicroelectronics.pdf).
